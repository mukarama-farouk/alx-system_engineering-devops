At about 15:30 UTC on November 10 2023, and at 18:30 UTC on that same day, an outage occurred on an ecommerce website managed by a friend. The outage affected the ecommerce platform, resulting in a 25% decrease in site availability. Users experienced slow page load times and intermittent errors during the outage.

There was misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers. The outage was detected when an engineer noticed a spike in error rates and latency during routine monitoring.

He took action by:
Investigated backend server logs for error patterns.
Assumed initially that increased traffic was causing server overload.
Explored database performance as a potential bottleneck.

He resolved this by identifying the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings and corrected them. Implemented a rolling restart of backend servers for immediate effect.

To avoid facing such outages in the future,
Implement regular audits of load balancer configurations to catch potential issues proactively.
Enhance monitoring alerts specifically for load balancer performance and configuration changes.
Address the misconfiguration identified to prevent future occurrences.
Document the incident, including the misconfiguration and resolution steps, for future reference.
Conduct a training session for the team on load balancer management best practices to avoid similar issues in the future.
